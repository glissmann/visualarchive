Course Description
This class explores the relationship between form and content: How is meaning
constructed and communicated through visual language? Through observing, collecting,
analyzing, writing, and form making, students apply design processes involving visual
research, concept generation, and craft skills.
Driven by research interest, students will use digital and analog means to build
visual archives. These collections are approached as a resource of critical inquiry and to
respond to current socio-political issues.
Students will develop projects and build up skills across media ranging from physical
collaging to digital artifacts and more complex visual essays for paper and for screen.
